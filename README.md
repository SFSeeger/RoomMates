Making organizing easy

### Development
#### Dev Container
1. Setup [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
1. Open this project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. A popup should open prompting you to `Reopen in Container`. In case this does not happen use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>⇧</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on macOS)  and type / select `> Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

#### Pre-Commit Hooks
We use pre-commit hooks to ensure consistent formatting and code quality in the project. `pre-commit` and the hooks should already be installed in the devcontainer.
